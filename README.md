# Multivariate prediction of cognitive decline in Parkinson's Disease
Supplementary methods and data 

## 1.	Cognitive Subtyping
Data from the Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) de-novo cohort, defined by a diagnosis of PD within two years and unmedicated for motor symptoms at baseline (n=423). Subjects underwent yearly cognitive diagnosis in accordance with Movement Disorder Society recommended criteria for dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), as previously reported. In brief, a confirmed MCI diagnosis was based on an impaired performance on at least 2 test scores at 1-2 standard deviations below the standardized mean. Dementia diagnosis required impaired performance in at least 2 cognitive domains coinciding with significant functional impairment resulting from cognitive state. 
Records of cognitive categorization from baseline to year eight were used to subset cases based on conversion of cognitive state. Cases with any annotation of dementia over this timespan where annotated as the dementia conversion group (n = 44), excluding 1 case who reverted to normal cognition after an annotation of dementia. MCI conversion cases where annotated as any record of MCI without any annotation of future dementia diagnosis (n = 24). To subset a cognitively preserved population based on longitudinal records, avoiding any effect of attrition and cognitive decline in unobserved observations, cases were defined as normal if only showing records of normal cognition during recorded visits up to and including year seven (n = 68). An additional 118 cases had cognitive assessments up to and including year seven but with fluctuating annotations of “Indeterminate” or of “Cognitive Complaint”. 


## 2.	Genotyping and polygenic scores
Whole blood DNA genotyping was performed on the NeuroX array by PPMI investigators following previously published methods. Raw data from 619 individuals covering 267,607 variants was quality assessed following [published recommendations](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6001694/) Following initial QC, autosomal data was extracted, plink files were recoded to vcf format and uploaded to the Michigan Imputation Server. Imputation was conducted using Eagle2 to phase haplotypes and Minimac4 using the 1000 Genomes reference panel (phase 3, version 5). An R2 filter score for imputation quality was set at 0.3. Following imputation, data was downloaded, converted to plink format and quality assessed following the previous criteria. Finally, genetic principal components were generated along with reference data from the 1000 Genomes Project and non-european cases removed based on qualitative assessment of clustering of the first two principle components. 582 samples passed qc (variants n = 2,287,446). 

Polygenic risk scores (PRS) were calculated using summary statistics from recent genome wide association studies for [Alzheimer’s Disease (AD)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-019-0358-2), [Parkinson’s Disease (PD)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28892059/), [Depression](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-018-0090-3), [Schizophrenia](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature13595) and [Education Attainment (EA)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-018-0147-3). For AD, the effect of the APOE region was excluded by removing the region chr19:45,116,911 – chr19:46,318,605. PRSice-2 software was used for polygenic risk score calculation, which automates clumping and p-value thresholding to generate a “best-fit PRS” for a target phenotype of interest. Phenotype was coded as a binary factor of 0 (Control) or 1 (PC) for this analysis, with the first eight genetic principal components as covariates.
